# Mixednutz Java API

The MixedNutz API is a foundation for a distributed social network.  It's based off of the MixedNutz.net social network and allows 3rd parties to implement their own social network that will interface with MixedNutz.net and other networks that implement this API.

While this API is written in Java, it is a simple spec that is intended to be JSON entities and webservice calls.  It can be ported to other languages fairly easily.
